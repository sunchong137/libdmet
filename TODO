Block class: 
- extrapolation calculations
- multiple roots
- dump and read binary integral file: need to modify block

  Done:
  - schedule class
  - evaluate operator
  - support just_run, optimize, restart_optimize, evaluate properties
  - handle restart files and save

Integral.py:
- read/write integrals in binary format

  Done:
  - read/write integrals in FCIDUMP format

lattice.py:
- find a better way to integrate with Hamiltonian

  Done:
  - transfer the old lattice code
  - write several general constructor of lattices, eg. square, graphene, cuprate
