## Dependencies

All dependencies are optional

- pyscf (https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf): provides routines to run quantum 
chemistry impurity solvers. If you need to use CASCI, CASSCF, DMRGCI or 
DMRGSCF, please install pyscf

- pathos (https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos): provides multithreading 
for various python matrix operations

- StackBlock (https://github.com/zhengbx/StackBlock): an faster alternative 
to the default Block DMRG solver. To use StackBlock as impurity solver, 
install from GitHub and create a symbolic link to the StackBlock path in the 
libdmet folder.
